EV Subsidy Calculator Requirements Document

1. Overview
Build a web based EV cost calculator that determines the final consumer price of a BYD electric vehicle in Thailand after applying all eligible subsidies, excise tax reductions, and incentives under Thailand’s EV 3 point 5 policy.

The user selects a BYD model, and the system automatically applies all logic to:
• determine which subsidies apply
• calculate the final consumer cost
• display each subsidy individually
• show manufacturer and government incentives as informational badges

The app should support both desktop and mobile browsers.

2. Core Features
2.1 Model selection
The user selects from a list of BYD models sold in Thailand.

Models must include:
• BYD Dolphin
• BYD Seal
• BYD Atto 3
• BYD Han
• BYD Tang

Each model must have:
• model name
• base price in THB
• fuel type (BEV or PHEV)
• export model flag
• subsidy eligibility values

Models stored in a JSON structure.

3. Data Structure (JSON)
Example:
{
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "BYD Dolphin",
      "price": 859999,
      "eligible_rebate": false,
      "eligible_excise": true,
      "export_model": false
    },
    ...
  ]
}

4. Calculation Logic
4.1 Consumer rebate
Rebate is seventy five thousand THB if:
model.price > 2000000 AND eligible_rebate = true

4.2 Excise tax reduction
All BEVs receive two percent excise tax reduction.

Formula:
excise_discount = (base_price minus subsidy_cash) times 0.02

4.3 Import duty exemption
Informational only:
"Import duty exemption applied: yes"

4.4 Corporate tax incentives
Informational only:
"Corporate income tax exemption: eight years plus five years at fifty percent"

4.5 Export credit
If export_model = true:
production_credit = 1.5 units

4.6 Final price
price_after_subsidy = base minus subsidy
price_after_excise = price_after_subsidy minus (price_after_subsidy times 0.02)
final_price = round(price_after_excise, 2)

5. Output Requirements
Show:
• Base price
• Subsidy amount
• Excise discount
• Final price

Also list incentives:
• rebate eligibility
• excise reduction

6. UI Requirements
Inputs:

• optional override price
• toggle for export model

Outputs:

• incentive badges

Styling: clean minimal layout.

7. Additional Requirements
Project must include:
• model JSON file
• calculation utility
• model selection UI
• results display component

Architecture:
• modular functions
• calculation engine separate from UI
• full type definitions if using TS

8. Optional Features
